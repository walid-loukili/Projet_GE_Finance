## Project Overview  
This repository provides a complete workflow for **financial statement analysis** using **K-Means clustering** to segment companies based on financial performance. It builds on exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify meaningful clusters of companies with similar financial characteristics (e.g., profitability, leverage, valuation). The analysis generates actionable insights for investment decisions, risk management, and sector comparisons.

## Key Features  
✅ **End-to-End Workflow**:  
- Data cleaning, outlier removal, and feature engineering for financial metrics.  
- K-Means clustering with optimal cluster selection (Elbow Method + Silhouette Score).  
- Cluster interpretation using financial domain knowledge.  

✅ **Visual Insights**:  
- Correlation heatmaps, sector performance comparisons, and time-series trends.  
- Cluster visualizations (PCA-reduced 2D plots, box plots, radar charts).  

✅ **Actionable Outputs**:  
- Cluster labels assigned to companies.  
- Investment strategies tailored to cluster risk/return profiles.
